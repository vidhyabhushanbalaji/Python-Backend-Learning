## Python Backend Learning

This repository is created to mentor students on learning the basics of Python backend frameworks such as Flask and FastAPI, with a focus on building RESTful APIs.

⸻

📘 Task 1: Building a Simple Backend Application

This repository includes an HTML file with predefined input fields and functionality. You are required to build the Python backend server that interacts with this HTML page. The goal is to simulate a basic full-stack application.

✅ Requirements
	1.	Write your backend code in server.py.
	2.	You may choose either FastAPI or Flask to build your server.
	3.	Your backend should run on port 8501.
(Note: The port number will be provided as input to your backend application.)

🧠 Functionalities to Implement

Your backend server should implement the following 3 features:

1. Multiply 3 Numbers
	•	The HTML page will allow users to input 3 numbers.
	•	Your backend should receive these numbers via a POST request.
	•	Multiply the numbers and return the result to the frontend.

2. Upload an Image
	•	The HTML page provides an option to upload an image.
	•	Your server must accept the uploaded image and store it locally.

3. Show Uploaded Images
	•	When triggered from the frontend, your backend should return and display all previously uploaded images.

🎯 Key Learnings

By completing this task, you will learn:
	•	🔁 How to handle POST requests in your backend
	•	🖼️ How to send files (like images) from frontend to backend
	•	📤 How to return and render data (including images) from backend to frontend
